# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Baseball-Analytics-


•	Applied ARIMA models for time series forecasting of baseball player performance metrics like Batting Average, Home Runs
•	Executed stationarity tests, parameter tuning, model fitting, residual diagnostics, and forecasting with confidence intervals
•	Identified the best-fitting ARIMA (2,2,0) model with AIC: 92.94 and BIC: 95.26, enabling accurate 5-season forecasts 


Forecasting for ARIMA (2,2,0)

Here is the forecast for the next 5 seasons, along with the original 'R' (Runs) time series:

 

The blue line represents the original 'R' time series, the orange line represents the forecasted values, and the shaded area represents the confidence intervals of the forecasts.

As we can see, the ARIMA (2,2,0) model predicts in 'R' over the next 5 seasons.

We can see that the forecasted runs will be around interval of 70 to 90. 

Based on these forecasts can decide whether to buy a player or renew a contract.



Recommendation and Conclusion: This time series forecasting approach, incorporating model fitting, summary analysis, and visualization, equips stakeholders with a robust tool for anticipating player performance in the upcoming seasons. The ARIMA model, validated through detailed statistical analysis, contributes to informed decision-making in the dynamic context of sports analytics. Continued monitoring and refinement of the model may further enhance its predictive accuracy over time.
